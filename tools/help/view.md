Show the data available in the Radiant app in a table format. 

#### Datasets

Choose one of the datasets from the drop-down menu that were loaded into Radiant through the Manage tab.

#### Select columns

By default all columns in the data are shown. Click on any variable to focus on it alone. To select several variables use the SHIFT and ARROW keys on your keyboard. On a mac the CMD key can also be used to select multiple variables. The same effect is achieved on windows using the CTRL key.

#### Browse the data

By default only 15 rows of the data are shown. You can change this setting through the 'records per page' drop-down. Press the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons at the bottom-right of the screen to move through pages of the data.

#### Sort

Click on a column header in the table to sort the data by the values of that variable. Clicking again will toggle between sorting in ascending and descending order. To sort on multiple columns at once press shift and then click on the 2nd, 3rd, etc. column you would like to sort by.

#### Subset

There are several ways to select a subset of the data to view. For variables that have a limited number of different values (e.g., a factor) you can type a value in the text box below the column for one, or more, variables. For continuous variables use the Subset box on the left. Here you can use > and < signs and even combine filter commands. For example, x > 3 & y == 2 would show only those rows for which the variable x has values larger than 3 __and__ for which y has values equal to 2. Type your filter statement in the Subset box and press enter to see the result on screen.
