Plot the data.

#### Box plots

The upper and lower "hinges" of the box correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles) in the data. The middle hinge is the median value of the data. The upper whisker extends from the middle hinge to the highest value in the data that is within 1.5 x IQR of the middle hinge, where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles. The lower whisker extends from the middle hinge to the lowest value in the data within 1.5 x IQR of the middle hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers could be outliers and are plotted as points (as suggested by Tukey).

#### Subset

Use Subset to select (or omit) specific sets of rows from the data. You can use > and < signs and even combine filter commands. For example, x > 3 & y == 2 would select only those rows for which the variable x has values larger than 3 __and__ for which y has values equal to 2. Type your filter statement in the Subset box and press enter to see the result on screen.
